Environmental Task
Report

To complete the Environmental Task we have decided to use pygame package as, at least for us, this is the most intuitive program from the ones available.
Our team (Martyna Drumińska, Weronika Skowrońska, Przemysław Andrzejewski, and Tao-Sen Chang) has chosen the Waiter Project, and therefore our grid is adjusted to such kind of task.
Using numpy arrays we have created a 16 by 16 grid of white squares on the black background, each representing one possible interaction field. We then marked some of them as the “tables” and the “kitchen” - using, respectively, green and red color. We have decided our agent to be blue.
 

As for now, the user can move the agent with his arrows.
